## Features

To complete this challenge, I needed to add the following funcionalities to the app, and pass all tests.

* ``List dishes``: The ``Dashboard`` page should list the dishes from an API response, filtering by category and/or text search.
* ``List categories``: The ``Dashboard`` page should list all food categories from an API response.
* ``List orders``: The ``Orders`` page should list all orders made by the user.
* ``List favorites``: The ``Favorites`` page should list all of the user's favorited dishes.
* ``Create and order``: Selecting a dish on the ``Dashboard`` page should redirect to the ``Cart`` page. There the user can see ``total price``, adjust ``quantity``, and add or remove ``extras``. Pressing the order button will create a new order.
